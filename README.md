# MP3_Tag_Reader
 MP3 tag reader is a software which will read and display MP3 (ID3) tag information from MP3 /MPEG files. The software will be desktop based and not web based. This solution will read the given MP3 file, extract various tag information and display them via command line. We can also edit the different tags

# Project Description

This project is a C-based audio metadata editor designed to view and modify ID3 tags of an MPEG audio file. It provides a simple command-line interface to read, display, and edit audio metadata such as Title, Artist, Album, Year, and Comments.

The program is modularly designed using multiple source (.c) and header (.h) files, making it easy to understand, maintain, and extend. It demonstrates practical usage of file handling, structures, pointers, and bit-level operations in C, following a clean and structured approach.
